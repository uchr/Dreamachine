*Hope to see gif with ZoÃ« here*

It is a tool for viewing and exporting assets from *DreamFall: The Longest Journey*. Currently it can export meshes and part of textures to **FBX**. I'm working on this tool as part of a [remake](https://youtu.be/LZ3Gs5kFNkg) of a small level from *DreamFall: The Longest Journey* on Unreal Engine 4.

## Analogs

There is a great [DreamView](https://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/dreamfall/), which was made by the wonderful Tobias Pfaff back in 2006. This tool can export meshes to DirectX, Milkshape or HalfLife2 formats and import them back. I am very grateful to Tobias Pfaff for the work and I regularly return to this tool for references.
